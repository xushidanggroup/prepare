abstract: Photodynamic therapy is arising as a noninvasive treatment modality for cancer and other diseases. One of the key factors to determine the therapeutic function is the efficiency of photosensitizers (PSs). Opposed to traditional PSs, which show quenched fluorescence and reduced singlet oxygen production in the aggregate state, PSs with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) exhibit enhanced fluorescence and strong photosensitization ability in nanoparticles. Here, the design principles of AIE PSs and their biomedical applications are discussed in detail, starting with a summary of traditional PSs, followed by a comparison between traditional and AIE PSs to highlight the various design strategies and unique features of the latter. Subsequently, the applications of AIE PSs in photodynamic cancer cell ablation, bacteria killing, and image-guided therapy are discussed using charged AIE PSs, AIE PS molecular probes, and AIE PS nanoparticles as examples. These studies have demonstrated the great potential of AIE PSs as effective theranostic agents to treat tumor or bacterial infection. This review hopefully will spur more research interest in AIE PSs for future translational research.

abstract: Three dibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide-based alternating copolymers were synthesized by facile Suzuki polymerization for visible light–responsive hydrogen production from water (> 420 nm). Without addition of any cocatalyst, FluPh2-SO showed a photocatalytic efficiency of 3.48 mmol h−1 g−1, while a larger hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 4.74 mmol h−1 g−1 was achieved for Py-SO, which was ascribed to the improved coplanarity of the polymer that facilitated both intermolecular packing and charge transport. To minimize the possible steric hindrance of FluPh2-SO by replacing 9,9′-diphenylfluorene with fluorene, Flu-SO exhibited a more red-shifted absorption than FluPh2-SO and yielded the highest HER of 5.04 mmol h−1 g−1. This work highlights the potential of dibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide as a versatile building block and the rational design strategy for achieving high photocatalytic efficiency.
